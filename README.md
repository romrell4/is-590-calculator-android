# IS 590R HW 5

In this homework, I tried my best to get a recycler view working. I kept having issues until I finally realized that I needed to set the layout manager for the dang recycler view! I can't believe that I missed that twice! I got it working in Kotlin, which was cool. The results are in my compass activity.
