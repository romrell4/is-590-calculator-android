# IS 590R HW 4

In this homework, I converted my HW 3 to use only ConstraintLayout. I found this to be helpful, however, I still wish I could figure out how to use the RecyclerView instead of using copied and pasted TextViews. It wasn't very difficult to replace the Linear and Relative layouts in the CompassActivity, but I found that the Android Studio UI was a lot more tedious than Xcode. The UI started to look REALLY ugly, whereas the same constraints in Xcode would have looked fairly clean. I also haven't learned how to have the idea of an inequality for the constraint (greater than or equal to...). Still work to come!
